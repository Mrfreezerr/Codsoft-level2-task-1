        <h2>The Father of the Nation</h2>
        <p>
            Mahatma Gandhi, also known as Bapu, was a preeminent leader in India's struggle for independence against
            British colonial rule. His principles of non-violence, civil disobedience, and truth inspired movements
            worldwide and continue to guide generations.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Principles of Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ahimsa (Non-Violence):</strong> Gandhi believed in the power of non-violence as a means to
                achieve social and political change.</li>
            <li><strong>Satyagraha (Truth and Firmness):</strong> He popularized the concept of satyagraha, a form of
                non-violent resistance based on truth and moral courage.</li>
            <li><strong>Swadeshi Movement:</strong> Gandhi promoted the use of locally made products to reduce
                dependence on British goods, fostering economic self-sufficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Sarvodaya (Welfare of All):</strong> Gandhi advocated for the well-being and upliftment of all
                individuals, especially the marginalized and oppressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Living and High Thinking:</strong> Gandhi believed in a life of simplicity, focusing on
                inner development and spiritual growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Satyagraha for Social Change:</strong> He applied satyagraha to address social issues like
                untouchability and unfair treatment of lower castes.</li>
            <li><strong>Constructive Program:</strong> Gandhi emphasized practical initiatives for social, economic, and
                educational development.</li>
            <li><strong>Khadi Movement:</strong> He promoted the use of khadi (handspun cloth) to encourage
                self-reliance and support local industries.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasting and Self-Purification:</strong> Gandhi used fasting as a means to protest and purify his
                own soul, while also influencing change.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Vision:</strong> Gandhi's principles transcended borders, emphasizing unity among all
                nations and the importance of global harmony.</li>

        <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
        <p>
            Mahatma Gandhi's legacy extends beyond India's struggle for independence. His philosophy and methods of
            non-violent resistance have inspired countless movements for social justice, civil rights, and freedom
            around the world. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Cesar Chavez drew inspiration
            from Gandhi's principles. His teachings continue to be relevant in promoting peace, equality, and human
            rights.

        </p>
        <p>
            Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Cesar Chavez drew inspiration from Gandhi's
            principles and applied his strategies to their respective movements.
            The Civil Rights Movement in the United States, the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, and the fight
            for farm workers' rights in the United States are just a few
            examples of movements deeply influenced by Gandhi's philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gandhi's legacy reminds us that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, the power of
            non-violence and truth can bring about meaningful change. His
            emphasis on the dignity and worth of every individual serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy,
            compassion, and respect for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, as the world grapples with ongoing issues of injustice, inequality, and conflict, Mahatma Gandhi's
            teachings remain relevant and essential. His life and work
            inspire us to strive for a more just, peaceful, and harmonious world where dialogue and understanding
            prevail over violence and division.
